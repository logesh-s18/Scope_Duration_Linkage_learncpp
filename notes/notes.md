Chapter <Scope, Duration, and Linkage: 


<7.6 - Internal linkage>





## New things I learned

- extern var and function forward declaration are same behavior (diff with syntax which means, non-constant global variable declaration without extern keyword is not a "declaration". ITS A DEFINITION.)
- static and const var are similar with linkage and its copies but different with their modify behavior

## Example / Code I tried
- available in GitHub commits




## Things that confused me

- Internal Linkage and External Linkage with static and extern keywords



## Important notes / rules

- Functions, namespaces, non-constant global variables are by default External Linkage
- const variables, static are by default Internal Linkage



## Quick summary (in my own words)

- learned about use of static, extern, const with different files with namespaces
